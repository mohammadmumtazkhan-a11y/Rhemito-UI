Build a high-fidelity Desktop UI prototype for a Fintech application called "Rhemito" using React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion for animations.

The design should be clean, modern, and responsive, featuring a sidebar navigation and a main content area. Use a color palette of Primary Blue (#2563EB), Teal (#14B8A6), and Purple (#8B5CF6) on a white/gray background.

I need the following specific screens and flows implemented:

### 1. Dashboard (Home Screen)
* **Layout:** Left sidebar navigation (Overview, Transactions, Recipients, Compliance, Support, Settings, Logout). Top header with User Profile ("Welcome Olayinka") and Notifications.
* **Main Content:**
    * **Quick Services Card:** A distinct card showing action buttons. Existing buttons are "Send Money" (Blue) and "Airtime Topup" (Purple). **ADD A NEW BUTTON:** "Request Payment" (Teal/Green).
    * **Account Summary:** Display Wallet Balance (e.g., 300 GBP) and Total Sent.
    * **Recent Transactions Table:** Columns for Ref No, Recipient, Service, Date, Amount, Status, Actions.

### 2. Request Payment Flow (The Core Feature)
When the user clicks "Request Payment", navigate to a dedicated multi-step form:

**Step 1: Transaction Details (The "They Send, You Receive" Logic)**
* Implement a currency converter logic where the user defines what they want to *receive*.
* **Input Field:** "I want to receive" (Amount in GBP).
* **Read-Only Calculation:** "Sender pays" (Auto-calculated Amount in NGN based on a mock exchange rate, e.g., 1 GBP = 2000 NGN).
* *Note:* The user mentioned "They Send, You Receive" logic is critical here.
* **Payment Method:** Dropdown to select how the sender will pay (e.g., "Bank Transfer", "Card").

**Step 2: Sender Information**
* Collect details about the person paying.
* **Fields:**
    * Sender Name (Required)
    * Sender Email Address (Required - for sending the payment link)
    * Sender Mobile Number (Optional - for WhatsApp/SMS)
    * Sender Date of Birth (Optional)
    * Reason for Payment / Invoice Description (Optional)

**Step 3: Review & Confirm**
* Display a summary card showing:
    * "You Receive: £[Amount]"
    * "Sender Pays: ₦[Amount]"
    * Sender Name & Email.
    * **Disclaimer:** Add a warning text: "Kindly contact your sender to ensure this request comes from you."

### 3. Success State
* Show a success animation (checkmark).
* Display text: "Payment Request Sent Successfully to [Sender Name]".
* **Shareable Link:** Generate a mock URL (e.g., `remito.com/pay/ref123`) with a "Copy Link" button so the user can send it manually via WhatsApp.

### 4. (Optional) Sender View
* Create a simple standalone page that represents what the Sender sees when they click the link.
* It should show: "Olayinka is requesting £100 (₦200,000)".
* Button: "Pay Now" (which opens a mock payment modal).

**Technical Requirements:**
* Use `lucide-react` for icons.
* Use `react-router-dom` for navigation between Dashboard and Request Flow.
* Ensure the "Request Payment" button on the Dashboard is prominent.
